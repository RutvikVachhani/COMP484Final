                      piece of fruit is one serving. A cup of pasta equates 2
                      servings and a pint of ice cream contains 4 servings.

                      which increases your appetite,” says Hopsecger.

                      Fiber helps improve blood sugar control, helps lower
                      cholesterol and reduces your risk of chronic diseases like
                      diabetes, colorectal cancer and heart disease. When you
                      have diabetes, a diet with fewer carbs (like bread, pasta,
                      rice, desserts, sugary beverages, juice) is also important
                      because you’ll need less insulin. And that can help
                      prevent hunger, fat storage and weight gain.
